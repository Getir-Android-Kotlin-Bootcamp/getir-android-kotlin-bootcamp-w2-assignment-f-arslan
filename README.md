# Getir Android Kotlin Bootcamp w2 Assignment

#### Looking for a place? Just type its name into the search bar and get all the location info you need. Want to know where you are right now? Hit the "My Location" button on the bottom-right, and you're all set.
####  You can search for places anytime, no permission needed. But if you're trying to use the "My Location" button, we'll need to ask for your location permission first. Don't worry, if we need it, we'll pop up a quick message asking for your okay.

#### Once granted, the app will remember your preference, and upon subsequent launches, it will automatically take you to your current location without further prompts.

#### The only difference from the screenshot is that the location pin doesn't have a purple background colour. We discussed it in class, and I removed it for a cleaner look.
